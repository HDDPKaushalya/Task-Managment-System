Using PHP 
Employee registration and task registration systems play a pivotal role in ensuring that
employees are appropriately onboarded and assigned tasks in a structured and organized manner.
In this introduction, we will explore the concept of employee registration and task registration
systems and how to create them using PHP and HTML.

Using PHP/HTML for Employee and Task Registration:
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) are widely used for
creating web-based applications and systems. These technologies are well-suited for building
employee and task registration systems due to their simplicity, versatility, and compatibility with
web browsers.
In the following sections, we will guide you through the process of creating basic employee
registration and task registration forms using PHP and HTML. These forms will serve as the
foundation for developing more comprehensive systems tailored to your organization's needs.
